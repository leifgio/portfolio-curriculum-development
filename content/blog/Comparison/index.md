Last time i chose Xaringan presentations using Rmarkdown. Those two are very different platform. Canva is a WYSWYG application while Xaringan rely one codes. Canva's usability is a lot simpler than Xaringan, though there is a drawback. Canva has paid version where you can access all design templates. And the other one is free and open source. The learning curve of both applications are also different. It is easier to use canva without prior knowledge and experience. The other one requires your skills in coding.  Canva on the other side focus on the design and it caters a lot of use rather than Rmarkdown which is only for presentations. In conclusion, both of the applications have different strength and weakness.
