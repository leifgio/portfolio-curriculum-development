### Realizations on Curriculum Approaches

Approaches to the curriculum may vary depending on the educator's philosophy. Every individual has their own special set of skills and that can be used in a specific type of learning environment. Subjectively, there is no best approach to curriculum for everyone. But there is always a suitable approach that the educator can take advantage of. 

Personally, my teaching style has a bias on learner-centered approach. This is because of my career goals. In the future, I want to teach in higher education and this approach is the most suitable for college students. I want to target the different competencies of the learners without limiting their capabilities and interests. 

In addition to that, I want to implement different types of assessment that is in line with the learner-centered approach. But the problem is there is a study that I have discovered from our activity. New educators tend to be active participants in the classroom setup. Maybe this is an effect of transition from student life to a career person. 

Knowing the problem I will try my best as early as know, practice in our reporting, and practice teaching. I will always try to make the students engage in the learning experiences. Especially my chosen field is Computer Programming, a very technical subject. Learning by doing will make them familiar with the concepts of programming. 

In conclusion, I recommend to all my classmates to have regular introspection. Looking inside your feelings and state of mind will help you find the approach that suits your style. Occasionally I also write my ideas on my notes. As a modern student, I write digitally and I organize it later on using Taskade.
