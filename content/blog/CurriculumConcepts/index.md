### Realizations on the Purpose of Curriculum

You are about to look inside the mind of a dedicated student to learn effectively by the existence of a curriculum. With the guidance of the new and improved curriculum schools are thriving to produce globally competitive individuals. The standardization of the contents taught in school drastically changed the quality of life in terms of utilizing different technologies. The question is how do these advancements in curriculum impact future educators?

Inside the post-modern classrooms, students and teachers are interdependent towards a common goal. That specific goal is to empower the mind by having an interactive discussion. This idea started from the progressive point of view of curriculum. The objective is to conduct experiential learning in achieving actualization.

The development of the curriculum has come to a systematic approach and this is proposed by Hilda Taba. Identifying the learner's needs is the key component to create an effective course of study. This practice can be observed in our education in the Philippines. Educators became flexible throughout the evolution of the curriculum. Since the 21st-century learners have been exposed to different types of media. Educators took advantage of that fact and used different media to cater to the needs of these learners.

The strong effect of progressive philosophy in the curriculum is beneficial to the stakeholders of the curriculum. As a future teacher, I will describe the importance of curriculum using a metaphor. The curriculum is the heart of education. Yes, education can exist without the curriculum but it will not last long and evolve like the curriculum we have nowadays.

In conclusion, the purpose of curriculum development is the help future educators. By constantly improving the curriculum as stakeholders we can call education our legacy. Developing a curriculum is a collective effort so I encourage everyone to participate in research on how we can improve the curriculum.
