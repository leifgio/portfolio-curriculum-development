Another week of a hectic schedule for the students since we are through with the academic consolidation week welcomes us to an intriguing exchange of views. In this week we tackled the tools for curriculum assessment. This topic is directly related to another topic which is assessment in learning 2. Criteria are developed by the assessor to set standards on performance assessment. This tool is crucial in determining the competencies of the learners. Aside from the performance measuring tools, we are also enlightened about the combination of strategies for recording the progress of the learners. 

This week also encourages the educators on tracking the behavior of our learners. This is an important role of the teachers, that's why we also have subjects in behavioral sciences for us to understand that there will be a diverse set of students for us to encounter in the future. 

Listening to the discussion persuaded me to pursue getting a job in the industry and choose a different career far from teaching. Maybe on the fact that the being a teacher also comes with great responsibility. But the reporters managed to let us appreciate these tools. Even though they enumerated the laborious tasks of teachers they also stated the importance of these processes. 

In conclusion, my heart is still into teaching but I am also worried about the amount of hard work that I will exert in the future. But imagining having an impact on students' lives inspires me to pursue this career. I know someday in the future that I can create my legacy in the teaching industry.
