### My experience as a reporter of this topic

Preparing for this lesson is an enjoyable experience for me. Finding the appropriate resources is a hard task but the process of reading and digesting the content is rewarding. Information overload also happened but now I am just laughing to myself that I read a lot of articles that is not connected to our topic. 

Now let us go to the real basics of curriculum designing. First, we all want to avoid a curriculum overlap as a curriculum designers. The question is who does this job in school? The educators' job is to conduct a diagnostic test in the orientation. So you can adjust the recommended curriculum that is given to you. 

Next, I want to describe the curriculum design by using a simile. The process of curriculum designing is like sewing fabric together. The content should connect flawlessly, it means prior knowledge has importance to the future topics that will be encountered. This single paragraph is a short explanation of balance, articulation, scope, integration, continuity, and sequence. 

But the night before this discussion I was not feeling well. I was worried that it can affect my delivery during the discussion. In addition to that, the weather is unpleasant. But thanks to the ears of my classmates we still managed to deliver it flawlessly. And upon checking their essays, I have seen that they appreciated our discussion.

In conclusion, designing a curriculum has things to consider. Research and observation must be administered. Teaching also requires hard work since at every start of the school year the design should be revised.
