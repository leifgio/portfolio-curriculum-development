A fresh start of the year welcomes us with an interesting discussion wherein we talked about the past and the present states of the curriculum. This topic revolves around the Curriculum Assessment here we can see the outcome of the efforts of the curriculum practitioners and developers. The practitioners or educators are expected to attain the objective that is planned from the early stage of curriculum planning. And this Curriculum Assessment will be the basis for the upcoming curriculum. As we transition from Basic Education Curriculum (BEC) to K12 Curriculum. The subjects will evolve to curriculum needs. Another aspect of evolution is the approach to teaching where the practitioners are less focused on delivering the instruction. Despite the changes in approach, this will result in more learning experiences for the learners. 

I also want to share my experience on the given activity by the reporters of this topic. That learning experience allows us to find the purpose of assessment in relation to the curriculum. As an educator, formulating attainable objectives will shape the learners effectively. In the achieved curriculum also indicates the performance of the learners that will make the educators proud if it is congruent to the intended curriculum. However, measuring the curriculum will be a tough task for educators since there are discrete types of assessments. 

In the end, I want to give credit to the reporters. They gave us a task to internalize the importance of Curriculum Assessment. They also raised awareness on achieving the goals of the curriculum. This character also reflects on my attitude as well, being a goal-oriented person makes this lesson a valuable topic for me.
