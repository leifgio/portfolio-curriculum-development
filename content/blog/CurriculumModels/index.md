# Realizations on Design Models

Here we are taught that there are four particular parts of designing and those are, learning objectives, bridge-ins, contents, and assessments. If we are to relate this statement to our second topic which is components of the curriculum and curricular practices. We can see that the interrelationship of the Components of the Curriculum is still the heart of designing. As a student, I always check the connection of topics and that helps my cognition. 

We talked about the different types of design, their advantages, and their disadvantages. Each of those designs caters to a specific level of attainment in education. And I always see myself as a future college instructor. My preferred design is Problem-Centered, a high-level approach of teaching that will challenge the learners and at the same, not a spoon-feeding approach of teaching. This type of approach will also require a progressivist philosophy. But I will still keep in mind that moth design is equally important. And by incorporating the subject-centered design, which gives the learners an equal amount of knowledge in a certain field. For example in computer programming major, we also practice subject-centered design to become fluent in the technical terms that a programmer should know. 


My favorite part of the discussion is about the purpose of Taba's model of curriculum. Here we all see that there is really a science in developing a curriculum. A scientific approach will always tell the reason for the importance of the curriculum. Learning does not only take place in the mind of learners. The Educator can also experience learning in choosing what approaches and contents are applicable.

In conclusion, we should keep in mind the interrelation of components of the curriculum. And teaching should focus on different aspects of the learning approach. Last developing a curriculum takes time so the value of being an educator increased after we talked about this topic.
