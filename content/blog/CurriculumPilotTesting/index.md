### Realizations on Pilot Testing, Monitoring and Evaluating the Curriculum

Another lively discussion of interesting ideas from my classmates took over the meeting. The topic is preliminary studies before conducting the curriculum. Pilot testing is a developmental process before the implementation of curriculum. Here the curriculum makers are researching about the reliability of effectiveness of curriculum. This process is quite similar to formulating assessment, where those two variables are important in determining the effectiveness of assessment method.

Before this topic I had no idea that pilot testing is a thing. My assumptions about implementing is the information is crowd sourced. This might be true but there is additional process needed. This process is also comparable to software development, as discussed in the class. But my realization is different, in software life cycle the developers are testing the application before the deployment. This is done to know the possible errors in the system. This is similar in curriculum development where in simulating the curriculum through pilot testing and strengthen the planned curriculum.

One of the things that the class enjoyed is the split ideologies about modification and revision. Here I exampled an analogy in iphones and I think that also sparked the interest to have a in-depth conversation about the different standpoint. In the end, we all learned that there are factors that affects the modifications in curriculum.

Moving on, we are still in the process of curriculum implementation and the next steps are monitoring and evaluation. Another laborious process in implementing the curriculum, why? The process of gathering data is still progressing hence the outcome is also ambiguous. Being filled with a lot of procedures the reporters also emphasized the importance of these steps in achieving a effective curriculum.

All in all curriculum implementation is a lengthy process but the fruit of labor is significant. And as a future educator, considering these important aspects are added in my arsenal. I will always keep in mind that I am a part of curriculum implementation. To my fellow students, let us work together in to prove that our curriculum is effective. That means we all need to be competent and pass the Licensure Examination for Teachers. For this is the one of the methods in evaluating the curriculum.
