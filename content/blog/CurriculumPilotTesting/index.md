### Realizations on Pilot Testing, Monitoring and Evaluating the Curriculum

Another lively discussion of interesting ideas from my classmates took over the meeting. The topic is preliminary studies before conducting the curriculum. Pilot testing is a developmental process before the implementation of the curriculum. Here the curriculum makers are researching the reliability or effectiveness of the curriculum. This process is quite similar to formulating assessment, where those two variables are important in determining the effectiveness of the assessment method.

Before this topic, I had no idea that pilot testing is a thing. My assumption about implementing is the information is crowdsourced. This might be true but there is an additional process needed. This process is also comparable to software development, as discussed in the class. But my realization is different want to know why? In the software life cycle, the developers are testing the application before the deployment. This is done to know the possible errors in the system. This is similar to curriculum development wherein simulating the curriculum through pilot testing and strengthening the planned curriculum.

One of the things that the class enjoyed is the split ideologies about modification and revision. Here I exampled an analogy in iPhones and I think that also sparked the interest to have an in-depth conversation about the different standpoints. In the end, we all learned that there are factors that affect the modifications in the curriculum.

Moving on, we are still in the process of curriculum implementation and the next steps are monitoring and evaluation. Another laborious process in implementing the curriculum, why? The process of gathering data is still progressing hence the outcome is also ambiguous. Being filled with a lot of procedures the reporters also emphasized the importance of these steps in achieving an effective curriculum.

All in all curriculum implementation is a lengthy process but the fruit of labor is significant. And as a future educator, considering these important aspects is added to my arsenal. I will always keep in mind that I am a part of curriculum implementation. To my fellow students, let us work together to prove that our curriculum is effective. That means we all need to be competent and pass the Licensure Examination for Teachers. For this is one of the methods in evaluating the curriculum.
