### Realizations on the Pilot Testing Part Two with Emphasis on School-Based Evaluation and Acrreditation

In curriculum evaluation, the professionals are assigned to these two tasks school-based evaluation and accreditation. During our stay at TUPC, we experienced being accredited. There is a feeling of pressure when the AACUP are inspecting the school and all of the teachers are busy with their requirements. Despite this situation, the University is happy to conduct the accreditation. And on this topic, we all have learned about the significance of accreditation on the curriculum.

In school-based evaluation, the objective is to have cohesiveness in all of the school concerns. From my observation, it is a regular practice in private schools. And the people involved in this type of evaluation can be anyone who is involved in that school. During my high school days, we are given an evaluation form that queries our feedback on school performance. The ideas of the students are also acknowledged since there are also open-ended questions that are included in that survey.

All the vision, mission, goals, and objectives of my schools from basic education up to now is to achieve global standards. In this lesson, the areas of accreditation are expected to be in line with the VMGO. The center of curriculum evaluation is the campus-side of the curriculum. This gave me a flashback at our topics regarding meta-cognitive principles of education. And that is about the psychology in education where the learners are also conditioned to learn in a friendly environment. And that is why the facilities, numbers of students, teaching methodologies are being assessed in accreditation.

Fast forward to curriculum outcomes, in higher education graduation requirements are also included in the grounds for accreditation. The student is expected to complete all the prerequisites to be able to graduate. The importance of this is in curriculum planning we need to identify what will be the result of the planned curriculum. Here we can observe if the outcome satisfies the objectives of the planned curriculum.

In conclusion, The process of curriculum development is a cycle for all the people involved in education. Other people say that "history repeats itself" this statement is also true in curriculum development. The first is to plan, implement, and then evaluate. This is a never-ending process since the world always seeks innovation and advancement. In the end, I recommend to all of the people that are striving for a bachelor's in education is to understand this process so that we can avoid the lapses that happened in paradigm shifts in the curriculum.
