### Realizations on the Curriculum Stakeholders

A short but informative discussion about the stakeholders of education. Stakeholders are people involved in the development of curriculum. In education, they are the one who contributed to the success of a school and students.

Currently I am the part of students when we talk about the stakeholders. And we are the focus of the curriculum. I assure that the curriculum that we are using is effective. Even if we are conducting online classes, the educators can adjust their modalities to accommodate the needs of the learners. 

In the future I want to climb up the ladder in the position of stakeholders. My first step is to implement the suitable curriculum for my future students. To achieve, that I must develop mastery in my chosen field. And I am fortunate to be in Technological University of the Philippines. And the mission of our school is to be at par in the Technology industry of South East Asia. 

Looking forward in the far future I also want to manage schools and be a curriculum manager. As early as now I always enjoy planning, and that is the main job of curriculum managers. Looking at it is stressful, but experiencing it will be fulfilling for me. 

In conclusion, throughout my life I will become a stakeholder of curriculum. Investing in education is needed for the betterment of humanity. Every type of stakeholder has different method in contributing to curriculum. But now I will always observe the curriculum to know the different roles of the stakeholders. Last is to do my best in the constant improvement of curriculum.
