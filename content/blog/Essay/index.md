Entering the Technical University of the Philippines - Cavite (TUPC) is my own personal
choice because before I entered the admission, I already did a research on the vision, mission,
asked my relatives that are alumni from this institution. There are things that I could not forget
during my journey in TUPC and as a student my duty is to fulfill the Vision, Mission, Goals and
Objectives (VMGO). The question is how can I manage to complete the perceived ideology of
our school? Let us dig deeper on my philosophy as a Bachelor of Technical Teacher Education
(BTTE) student. Also, will also be talking about the transformational things that happened to me
about my entire stay in TUPC.

According to the vision, excellence in technology education is the flagship of the
institution. I can agree to that because I encountered teachers that are alumni of TUPC during my
junior and senior high school days. All I can say is that they are well-versed instructor especially
in their field of specialization which is computer subject. Because of them I became interested in
TUPC and they are able to inspire me as a student. In fact, they are already teaching in EAC
which is also a recognized school here in the Philippines and across other countries. In this case,
my vision is to get a degree and give back the favor to this institution that shaped me to be better
person and help them to execute this vision.

The university professors are also competent and we can learn a lot from them. They are
the ones who are in charge of implementing the mission of the school. The professors are able to
produce good quality leaders to the point that they are able to maintain the positive impression in
our school. Here in Cavite there are many industrial factories that are connected with our school
and it is true that TUPC provide technical skills that are required in those companies. As a
student I can contribute to the school mission is to be a transformational leader that inspires other
people to work and study hard. Above all being an educator will make myself a good example of
motivation to my future students.

As can be observed the goals and objectives are being satisfied by the present students of
TUPC. I would like to encourage the administrative staff of the school by achieving this and
instilling discipline to the current students. To simply say that we are the product of collective
effort of every employee of TUPC. I can assure that I will become a quality educator because of
the excellence of the administration. From now on I will practice the core values of TUPIANS to
promote good governance. I will also continue to spread the positive impression to our school so
that we can produce more leaders in the future.

In conclusion, I will continue to strive hard and exert more effort since our goal can only
be achieved with hard work. And when the time comes that I am already prepared for this role, I
am responsible for further improvements in the school. To demonstrate my loyalty to the school,
I am willing to work for the school and share my knowledge after I finish in college. In particular
I want to be also in Industrial Education department so I can continue to learn on how to be a
outstanding educator.
