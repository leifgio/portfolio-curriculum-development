In this lively discussion was led by the group we all learned that the curriculum was tailor-made to the learners. It all boils down to the planning phase of curriculum development. The discussion highlight is the scientific approach in the teaching process. As a student, I managed to get the thought process of instructors why course guide exists. 

I guess the reporter's objective is for us to internalize the importance of all the phases. And if I were to choose one phase as my favorite process is still the planning phase. It goes well with my personality, as I like to observe and know the people around me. About planning, I assume that a lot of preparation is needed in this stage. This gives me fuel to indulge myself to teaching. 

Moving on to the two types of learning themes we witnessed that there are varieties of learners. Knowledge transfer is a challenge for us, future educators. Since we are now aware of behavioral and cognitive learning themes. It becomes easier for us to understand the learners enough. 

Going back to the teaching process, I want to clarify that I am not being biased toward the planning phase. In the evaluation phase, we realized that learners can be measured and observed. And it is a highly social process. Even with the implementation, this phase is the actual stage that learners process the information that is handed to them. 

To wrap this up, previous knowledge will have significance on what we are about to learn. And that is why the curriculum should be continuously developed. We also should be happy because we are still accepted in school despite our differences in our learning styles.
